# Employee Churn Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict employee churn using machine learning techniques. Employee churn, also known as employee turnover, refers to the phenomenon of employees leaving a company within a specific period. Predicting churn can help organizations take proactive measures to retain valuable employees, reduce recruitment costs, and maintain productivity.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical data about employees, including various features such as:
- Employee demographics (age, gender, education level)
- Job-related factors (salary, job role, tenure)
- Performance metrics (ratings, promotions)
- Work environment satisfaction (satisfaction scores, feedback)

## Methodology
The project follows the typical machine learning pipeline:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features if necessary.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the distributions, correlations, and patterns in the data through visualization and statistical analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features, perform dimensionality reduction, or transform existing features to enhance model performance.
4. **Model Selection**: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines, and gradient boosting to identify the best performing model.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the models using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and validate their performance using techniques like cross-validation.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune the chosen model's hyperparameters to optimize its performance further.
7. **Prediction and Deployment**: Deploy the final model to predict employee churn on new data.

8. The model is now live.

## Results
The results of the employee churn prediction model indicate its effectiveness in identifying potential churners within the organization. Key findings and insights gained from the analysis are documented in the project's report.

## Future Work
- Incorporate additional data sources for more comprehensive feature engineering.
- Explore advanced machine learning techniques such as deep learning or ensemble methods.
- Implement real-time monitoring of employee churn indicators for timely intervention.
